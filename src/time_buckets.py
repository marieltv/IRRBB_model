BCBS 368 (April 2016) — Annex 2, Table 2
The 19 prescribed repricing time buckets for notional cash flow slotting.

Each bucket is defined by:
  - label       : human-readable name
  - lower_years : lower bound in years (inclusive)
  - upper_years : upper bound in years (exclusive; None = open-ended)
  - midpoint    : representative tenor used for shock interpolation and
                  duration approximation (years)

Reference: BCBS 368, Annex 2, Table 2 — "Maturity schedule with 19 time
buckets for notional repricing cash flows".
